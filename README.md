# Data_Science_Book_Analysis

## Acknowledgments
This project was created for **CS 332 - Intro To Data Science**, written by **Dr. Ami Gates**, and devlivered through **Oregon State University** (Fall 2025). Training material from Dr. Gates is also available on her website, https://gatesboltonanalytics.com.

## Project Overview
According to Dr. Paul Wright, M.D. at the Neuroscience Institute, just 20 minutes of daily reading functions as an intellectual workout, yielding significant health benefits like reduced stress, improved sleep quality, boosted memory and cognition, enhanced resilience and empathy, and lowered blood pressure. Beyond these individual advantages, book clubs foster valuable social connections and a sense of community. Ultimately, a key driver for engaging in this activity is simple: reading a great book is fun. However, identifying interesting, well-written books from the overwhelming number available can be a challenge.
  
This data science project addresses that challenge by developing an analytical framework to pinpoint compelling books based on specific criteria. The project is a comprehensive, semester-long exercise designed to provide hands-on experience across the entire Data Science Lifecycle. The methodology begins with topic selection and data gathering (utilizing downloaded files and APIs), proceeds through data preparation, including cleaning, formatting, and normalization, and uses Matplotlib and Seaborn for effective initial insight communication. The core analysis leverages three datasets the New York Times Nonfiction Bestseller’s List, Goodreads' Top 100 annual ratings, and the author’s personal "Books Read" export. These datasets provide answers to specific questions, such as identifying highly-rated, popular nonfiction books the author hasn't yet encountered. The analytical core will apply both unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to the prepared data.
