Excellent on audio - I couldn't put it down! There are small portions of the book where the dialogue includes a stutter; you can feel the experience the writer is portraying with heartbreaking detail. <br/><br/>I am a parent of an 8yo with a moderate stutter, and this book was incredibly helpful for my husband and I. Each sentence my son speaks includes blocks. Trying to understand his day to day experience is diffifcult for us, as we have never stuttered. This book gave me a look into his world and the layers of work he does internally to communicate. For example, I did not realize the blanking his mind does in a block or that his neck soreness is probably related to his stuttering blocks. I wasn't recognizing the depth of his frustration and how difficult the teenage years can be with this condition. I was crying through the entire teenage section - prepare yourself.
